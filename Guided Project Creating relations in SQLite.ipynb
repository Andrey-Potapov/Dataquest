    "The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. Each row in our data represents a nomination for an award. Recall that our database file, nominations.db, contains just the nominations table. This table has the following schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Year - the year of the awards ceremony, integer type.\n",
    "- Category - the category of award the nominee was nominated for, text type.\n",
    "- Nominee - the person nominated for the award, text type.\n",
    "- Movie - the movie the nominee participated in, text type.\n",
    "- Character - the name of the character the nominee played, text type.\n",
    "- Won - if this nominee won the award, integer type.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's now add information on the host for each awards ceremony. Instead of adding a Host column to the nominations table and having lots of redundant data, we'll create a separate table called ceremonies which contains data specific to the ceremony itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a ceremonies table that contains the Year and Host for each ceremony and then set up a one-to-many relationship between ceremonies and nominations. In this step, we'll focus on creating the ceremonies table and inserting the data we need and in the next guided step, we'll focus on setting up the one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ceremonies table will contain 3 fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id - unique identifier for each row, integer type.\n",
    "- Year - the year of the awards ceremony, integer type.\n",
    "- Host - the host of the awards ceremony, text type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can create and insert into the ceremonies table, we need to look up the host for each ceremony from 2000 to 2010. While we could represent each row as a tuple and write a SQL query with an INSERT statement to add each row to the ceremonies table, this is incredibly cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python sqlite3 library comes with an executemany method that let's us easily mass insert records into a table. The executemany method requires the records we want to insert to be represented as a list of tuples. We then just need to write a single INSERT query with placeholder elements and specify that we want the list of tuples to be dropped into the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first create the list of tuples representing the data we want inserted and then we'll walk through the placeholder query we need to write. We'll skip over creating the ceremonies table for now since we've explored how to create a table earlier in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia lists the host(s) for each awards ceremony. Even though the 2010 ceremony had 2 hosts, we selected just the first host, Steve Martin, to keep things simple. Here's what the list of tuples looks like:\n",

    "            ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to write the INSERT query with placeholder values. Instead of having specific values in the query string, we use a question mark (?) to act as a placeholder in the values section of the query:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "insert_query = \"INSERT INTO ceremonies (Year, Host) VALUES (?,?);\"\n",
    "Since the placeholder elements (?) will be replaced by the values in years_hosts, you need to make sure the number of question marks matches the length of each tuple in years_hosts. Since each tuple has 2 elements, we need to have 2 question marks as the placeholder elements. We don't need to specify values for the id column since it's a primary key column. When inserting values, recall that SQLite automatically creates a unique primary key for each row.\n",
